      detail6: `Lamentosa's history is quite long and diffuse, to understand the context you must go to the library of some ancient clan, then you must ask a vampire leader for permission so that you can have access to the hidden books, in which it is possible to obtain knowledge. of the masters.`,

      detail11: `When I talked about knowing how to do politics, I wasn't kidding! As you stand out in the game, it will be natural for other vampires to approach you to live in your shadow, whether for protection, to gain some item or some knowledge about occult magic, in short, it is necessary to have a keen eye for approaches like this. , and if you are a good strategist, you will get support for an excellent goal: to become the great leader of the vampires. On the 3rd of each month an election takes place where the vampires elect the great leader for the next 30 days. The leader has a prominent role in the decisions of the race, he receives Tenebris items (very strong and indestructible) and can expel other vampires from a battlefield, for all this, it is a very sought after position.`,
      detail12:
        'Well, in short, this is what you need to know now, because if I were to talk about everything that can be done here, all the strategic possibilities, builds, etc., it would be a huge and very boring text. Another point is that we want you to socialize with other vampire players to clear your doubts :)',

No dia 3 de cada mês acontece uma eleição onde os vampiros elegem o grande líder para os próximos 30 dias. O líder tem um papel de destaque nas decisões da raça, ele recebe itens Tenebris (muito fortes e indestrutíveis) e pode expulsar outros vampiros de um campo de batalha, por tudo isso, é um cargo bastante visado.',
